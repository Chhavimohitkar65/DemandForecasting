# 🏥 **Demand Forecasting for Healthcare Inventory** | Optimizing Healthcare Supply Chain
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c995437-2fce-4fbc-9e76-128b719e7891
## **The Problem We Are Solving**
The demand for pharmaceuticals and medical supplies in healthcare institutions fluctuates unpredictably due to varying patient admissions and treatment requirements. This inconsistency causes:

- 🚫 **Stockouts**: Delaying treatments and reducing the quality of patient care.
- 📦 **Overstocking**: Tying up funds and consuming storage space.

Ineffective inventory management results in operational inefficiencies, increased costs, and lower overall service quality.

### **Key Challenges:**
1. **Data Variability and Quality**: Integrating diverse data sources (e.g., sales records, market trends, patient data) into coherent forecasting models presents significant technical challenges.
2. **Integration Complexity**: Managing and unifying multiple data streams to provide consistent and accurate forecasting.
3. **Dynamic Market Conditions**: Adapting models to the rapidly changing regulatory landscape and shifting patient preferences in healthcare.
